# Neovim & Tmux Configuration (Transition Phase)

This repository contains the configuration files for Neovim and Tmux. It is currently in a **transition phase**, actively evolving to enhance support for the following programming languages and tools:
- **TypeScript**
- **Golang**
- **Rust**
- **Python**
- **C++ (Arduino development)**

## Features

### Neovim
- Integrated with Tree-sitter for syntax highlighting and language parsing.
- Use `:TSProfilePicker` commands for targeted language profiles and configurations.
- Streamlined navigation using `Ctrl+n` for quick file exploration and management.

### Tmux
- Optimized for seamless workflow across multiple terminal panes and tabs.
- Enhanced productivity for developers working on multi-language projects.

### Zsh Shell
- Configuration implemented to work with **Zsh**, improving terminal efficiency and command handling.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-link>
   cd <your-repository-folder>
   ```

2. Symlink the Neovim configuration files to your Neovim directory:
   ```bash
   ln -s ~/path-to-repo/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
   ```

3. Symlink the Tmux configuration file:
   ```bash
   ln -s ~/path-to-repo/tmux-config ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

4. Make sure **Tree-sitter** and **Node.js** are installed for language support. For example:
   ```bash
   npm install -g tree-sitter-cli
   ```

5. Install plugins (Neovim):
   Open Neovim and run:
   ```vim
   :PlugInstall
   ```

6. Restart your terminal and Tmux session to apply changes.

## Future Plans
- Expand language-specific integrations and tooling support.
- Fine-tune `:TSProfilePicker` commands for improved developer experience.
- Incorporate additional shortcuts and navigation enhancements.
- Thoroughly work on each language support
- possible implementation of Claude  and AI Support.
- Streamline Zsh plugins for superior shell performance.
